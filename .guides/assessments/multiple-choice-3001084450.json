Layer 2 solutions are built on top of Ethereum, aim to improve its scalability and efficiency, and handle transactions off the main chain.\n\nThe incorrect options are:\n1. They are independent blockchains with their own consensus mechanisms - Layer 2 solutions are not separate blockchains but work directly with Ethereum.\n2. They do not rely on Ethereum's security - Layer 2 solutions do rely on Ethereum's security and decentralization.",
