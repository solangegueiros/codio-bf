## Why Tokenize on a Blockchain?

|||


Tokenizing assets on a blockchain refers to representing ownership or rights to real-world or digital assets as digital tokens on a blockchain. This process has several benefits and is becoming increasingly popular across various industries. 

Here are some key reasons for tokenizing assets on a blockchain:

### Increased Liquidity

**24/7 trading**: Tokenized assets can be traded on blockchain-based platforms around the clock, without the constraints of traditional market hours, increasing market accessibility and liquidity.

**Fractional ownership**: Tokenization allows assets to be divided into smaller parts, enabling fractional ownership. This can significantly increase liquidity, particularly for traditionally illiquid assets like real estate, art, or collectibles, by allowing a larger pool of investors to participate.

### Improved Accessibility

**Global reach**: Blockchain’s decentralized nature allows anyone with Internet access to invest in tokenized assets, eliminating geographical barriers and expanding the potential asset market.

**More affordable investment values**: By dividing assets into smaller tokens, tokenization makes it easier for a broader range of investors to participate in previously inaccessible markets.

### Enhanced Transparency and Security

**Smart contracts**: Tokenized assets are powered by [smart contracts](https://chain.link/education/smart-contracts), which automatically enforce the terms of agreements, reducing the need for intermediaries and ensuring that transactions are carried out as intended.

**Immutable records**: Blockchain technology ensures that the ownership history of tokenized assets is transparently recorded and cannot be altered, reducing the risk of fraud and enhancing trust among participants.

### Efficiency and Cost Reduction

**Reduced intermediaries**: Tokenization can streamline processes by reducing the need for intermediaries (e.g., brokers, escrow services), lowering transaction costs, and speeding up transactions.

**Automated Processes**: Smart contracts can automate complex processes such as dividend distribution, voting, and compliance checks, reducing administrative costs and human error.

### Transparency and Compliance

**Real-time monitoring**: Blockchain technology allows real-time tracking and monitoring of tokenized assets, making it easier for stakeholders to verify transactions.

**Regulatory compliance**: Tokenization can enhance compliance with regulatory requirements by embedding compliance rules directly into the tokens or smart contracts. This ensures that only eligible investors can participate and that transactions are automatically recorded for auditing purposes.

### Flexibility and Customization

**Programmable assets**: Tokens can be programmed to include specific rights, restrictions, or conditions, allowing for the creation of highly customizable financial instruments that can meet the particular needs of issuers and investors.

**Dynamic use cases**: Tokenized assets can be used in various ways beyond traditional trading, such as collateral in decentralized finance (DeFi), voting in governance systems, or access to digital services.

### Increased Trust and Security

**Decentralization**: [Blockchain](https://chain.link/education-hub/blockchain)’s decentralized nature reduces the risk of single points of failure, making tokenized assets more secure.

**Ownership verification**: Blockchain provides a clear, immutable record of ownership that all parties can easily verify. This reduces disputes and ensures that ownership claims are accurate.
