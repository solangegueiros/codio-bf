### Asset Tokenization Examples

|||


* **Real-world asset tokenization**—Real-world assets like fiat currency, equities, T-bills, credit, commodities, carbon credits, intellectual property, and fine art can be tokenized and stored on a blockchain. Gold bullion warrants and house deeds are bearer assets that give the holder a claim over a real-world asset. The main difference from legacy bearer assets is that physical asset tokenization enables assets to be stored, traded, and used as collateral across blockchain networks. ‍  
* **Digital asset tokenization**—Tokenizing assets that only exist in digital form on a blockchain network is critical to Web3, especially for use cases such as representing DAO governance rights and [cross-chain assets](https://chain.link/education-hub/cross-chain-tokenized-assets). Because they’re entirely digital, tokenized assets stored on a blockchain enable the owner to hold the asset outright rather than owning a claim on the underlying asset. ‍  
* **In-game asset tokenization**—A subset of digital asset tokenization, in-game assets used in GameFi projects or [metaverses](https://chain.link/education/metaverse), such as skins, weapons, or in-game currencies, can be represented as tokenized assets.
