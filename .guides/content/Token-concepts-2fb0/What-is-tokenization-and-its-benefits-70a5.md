## What Is Tokenization and What Are Its Benefits?

|||

[Tokenization](https://chain.link/education/asset-tokenization) is the process of representing an asset's ownership rights as digital tokens stored on a blockchain. These tokens act like digital certificates of ownership and can represent many assets, including physical, digital, fungible, and non-fungible items. Because they are stored on a blockchain, tokenized assets allow owners to maintain custody over them securely, often through a crypto wallet.

The benefits of tokenization are substantial. It offers a decentralized, trust-minimized alternative to traditional products, investment vehicles, and services. Using blockchain technology, tokenization makes assets more valuable, accessible, and useful. It enhances the liquidity of traditionally illiquid assets and provides greater accessibility to investment opportunities that were previously difficult to access. Additionally, tokenization brings increased transparency regarding ownership and ownership history while reducing administrative costs associated with trading, such as those related to management, issuance, and intermediaries. Importantly, tokenization enables assets that previously could not participate in the [decentralized finance (DeFi)](https://chain.link/education/defi) ecosystem to do so, unlocking new potential through asset-backed composability.
