## Block Explorers

|||


A block explorer is an online tool or web application that allows users to view, search, and track information on a blockchain. It is not the blockchain itself, meaning that if a block explorer is not working, it doesn’t affect the blockchain.

A block explorer can be defined as a “window” into the blockchain, enabling anyone to explore details about transactions, blocks, addresses, and other relevant data in real-time.
