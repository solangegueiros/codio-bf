## Introducing CCIP: Chainlink Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol

Chainlink CCIP is a blockchain interoperability protocol that enables developers to build secure applications that transfer tokens, messages (data), or both tokens and messages across chains using a standardized set of interfaces.

Given the inherent risks of cross-chain interoperability, CCIP features defense-in-depth security and is powered by Chainlink's industry-standard oracle networks. These networks have a proven track record of securing tens of billions of dollars and enabling over $15 trillion in onchain transaction value.

CCIP provides several key security benefits:

### Multiple Independent Nodes Run by Independent Key Holders

In CCIP, multiple nodes operate independently, each managed by separate key holders. Key holders are entities or individuals responsible for managing private keys that authorize transactions on the network. The independence of these critical holders is crucial because it prevents any single point of failure or centralized control, reducing the risk of collusion or malicious activity. CCIP ensures a more secure and decentralized network by distributing control across multiple independent parties.

### Separation of Responsibilities

There are distinct sets of node operators, and they don’t share responsibilities between the transactional DONs and the Risk Management Network.

Three separate decentralized oracle networks (DONs): 

1. Committing DON   
2. Executing DON for cross-chain transactions’ execution and validation  
3. RMN (Risk Management Network) is used for 2FA validation and executing and verifying every cross-chain transaction

### The Level-Five Interoperability Standard

CCIP provides Web3 projects with native [level-five cross-chain security](https://blog.chain.link/five-levels-cross-chain-security/) that can rapidly adapt to new risks or attacks in cross-chain messaging.
