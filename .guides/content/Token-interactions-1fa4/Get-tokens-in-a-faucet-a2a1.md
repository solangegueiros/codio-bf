## Get Tokens in a Faucet

|||


Ensure you have some testnet LINK tokens on Sepolia to execute the next step.

If you don't have the token yet, go to [https://faucets.chain.link/sepolia](https://faucets.chain.link/sepolia).  
Review the “Chainlink Testnet Faucet” topic in the “Wallets and Testnets” lesson if you do not know how to do it.
