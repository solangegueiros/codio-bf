## Interact With an NFT Marketplace on a Testnet

|||


Some decentralized marketplaces allow you to see NFT collections, buy, sell, trade, and see the NFTs you own. One of them is [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/).

OpenSea has become a popular site in the NFT ecosystem, attracting creators and collectors and playing a significant role in encouraging the adoption of NFTs and blockchain technology.

We are on Sepolia Testnet, and OpenSea is also available on some testnets.
