If you would like MetaMask to always be visible, click the Pin Icon to the left of the Kabab Button. This will make MetaMask easily accessible for the rest of the course. You can toggle this off if you want to revert it later.

### Create a new wallet

If you already have a Wallet (private key or mnemonic phrase), you can **Import an Existing Wallet**.   
For this course, choose “**Create a new wallet**”.

Agree to the Terms and Conditions of MetaMask by  
clicking on “I agree to MetaMask’s Terms of Use”.

If you already have some cryptocurrencies or tokens on mainnet, do NOT use the same wallet during the course or while learning.

Click on the button “Create a new wallet”.

### Create a password for MetaMask

The password created here is to unlock this extension in your browser. This password is not the mnemonic/backup phrase to your wallet or your private key. You will retrieve those in the following steps.

Click on “I understand that MetaMask cannot recover this password for me.”

If you forget or lose your password, you can still recover your wallet using the mnemonic/backup phrase saved in the next steps.

### Reveal your mnemonic/secret recovery phrase

The “secret recovery phrase” is a 12-word phrase that is the “master key” to your wallet and your funds.

Click on “Secure my wallet (recommended)”.

Save your Mnemonic

![Mnemonic reveal](.guides/img/02/image8.png "Mnemonic reveal")*Mnemonic reveal*


**Record your Mnemonic phrase in a secret, safe, and dry place.**

This is used to recover your account if you lose your password.

## Attention

**The seed phrase is the most important part of a wallet/account\!**  
**If you lose your seed phrase, you can not recover your wallet anymore.**
|||


### Where to save the secret recovery phrase

Write down this 12-word secret recovery phrase and save it in a place you trust and can only access it.

Some options:

* Save in a password manager  
* Store in a safe deposit box  
* Write down and store in multiple secret places

Never, ever share your secret recovery phrase, not even with MetaMask\!

If someone asks for your recovery phrase, they are probably trying to steal your wallet funds.

### Confirm the secret recovery phrase

Write back some words on the next screen to confirm that you saved your secret recovery phrase correctly.
