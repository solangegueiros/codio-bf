### Create a password for MetaMask

The password created here is to unlock this extension in your browser. This password is not the mnemonic/backup phrase to your wallet or your private key. You will retrieve those in the following steps.

Click on “I understand that MetaMask cannot recover this password for me.”

If you forget or lose your password, you can still recover your wallet using the mnemonic/backup phrase saved in the next steps.
