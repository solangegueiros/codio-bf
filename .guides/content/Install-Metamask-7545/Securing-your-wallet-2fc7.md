## Best practices

### Store your secret recovery phrase safely

Write down your Secret Recovery Phrase on paper and store it in a secure, offline location.

To prevent unauthorized access, avoid saving it digitally (e.g., in cloud storage or on your phone).

### Use strong, unique passwords

Create a robust and unique password for your wallet that combines upper and lower-case letters, numbers, and special characters.  
Do not reuse passwords from other accounts.

### Enable two-factor authentication (2FA)

If your wallet supports 2FA, it can be enabled to add an extra layer of security. Use an authentication app rather than SMS-based 2FA for better protection.

### Keep your software updated

Regularly update your wallet software to the latest version to benefit from security patches and improvements. Enable automatic updates if available.

### Be aware of phishing attacks

Always double-check URLs and email addresses to ensure they are legitimate before entering sensitive information.

Do not click on suspicious links or download attachments from unknown sources.

### Use hardware wallets for valuable holdings

Consider using a hardware wallet to store large amounts of cryptocurrency. It provides enhanced security by keeping your keys offline.

Follow the manufacturer's instructions for setup and use.

### Backup your wallet regularly

Regularly backup your wallet and ensure the backups are stored in a secure, offline location. Test your backup periodically to ensure it works correctly.

### Monitor your accounts

Regularly check your wallet and transaction history for any unauthorized activity. Set up alerts if your wallet provider offers them.

### Practice physical security

Keep your computer and devices secure using strong passwords, encryption, and physical security measures. Avoid accessing your wallet from public or shared computers.

### Educate yourself continuously

Stay informed about the latest security practices and threats in the cryptocurrency space.  
Participate in communities and forums to share and gain knowledge about wallet security.
