## Faucets: obtaining testnet tokens

|||

In the context of cryptocurrency, a faucet is a website or application that distributes small amounts of cryptocurrency or tokens to users, typically for free.

To interact with the Sepolia network, you must have some SepoliaETH. Different faucets can be used to get some. Usually, you can claim only a certain amount per day; the amount and regularity will depend on who is providing it.

A faucet is a web application that sends you tokens for a specific blockchain network.  For example, to get Ether testnet tokens, you'd have to choose an Ethereum testnet such as Sepolia.  Then, you'd go to the Sepolia Eth faucet and put in your wallet address so it can send you some tokens.
