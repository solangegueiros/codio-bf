### Chainlink Testnet Faucet

|||


Using the Chainlink Testnet Faucet, you can request testnet Sepolia ETH tokens.

Go to [https://faucets.chain.link/sepolia](https://faucets.chain.link/sepolia).

Ensure you have selected the Ethereum Sepolia network since this is where you want to receive the testnet ETH.

Click “Connect wallet” in the top right corner so the faucet app can detect the selected network and your wallet address.

Click on “I accept the Chainlink Foundation Terms of Service”.

Select Metamask

On Metamask, a pop-up window will appear.

“Confirm” in the next window.


After accepting the terms for using your metamask information, it will automatically populate the Wallet Address portions of the web form with your wallet.

Select whether you’d like to receive Sepolia testnet ETH and/or Sepolia testnet LINK.

For now, you will use only Sepolia ETH. However, you can also get the token LINK on Sepolia, which you can use in future modules.

Click on “Verify you’re human.”

To get SepoliaETH, you need to connect with your valid [GitHub](https://github.com/) account.

If you don't have it, you can create a new one at [https://github.com/](https://github.com/).  
This step is necessary to protect against spam requests.

Click on “Continue with GitHub”.

Click “Get tokens”. 

The tokens will be transferred from the faucet to the Metamask wallet address you connected to. Wait for the transaction to succeed; you will receive your tokens quickly.

The final result should look like the screenshot below.
