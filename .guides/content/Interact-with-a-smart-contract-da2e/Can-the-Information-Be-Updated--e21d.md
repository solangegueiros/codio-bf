### Can the Information Be Updated?

|||



Related to smart contracts, blockchains are immutable, which means that you can not update the source code.   
If you change anything in the source code, you must send a new transaction and deploy the smart contract again, creating a new smart contract with a new address.

But related to the data stored in the smart contract, it depends on the source code implemented.  
Regarding the Register, anyone can call the function “setInfo” again anytime.  
It means that YES, you can update the information 🙂

Let´s update the information to “Blockchain Fundamentals Certification”.

Click “SetInfo” again, wait for the transaction to be confirmed, and check it out on “getInfo”.
