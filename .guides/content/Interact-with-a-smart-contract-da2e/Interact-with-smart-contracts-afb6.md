# Interact With Smart Contracts

|||


After you have deployed a contract using the Remix IDE, you can interact with its functions directly on Remix.

### Calling Read-Only Functions  
Functions that don’t require a transaction (view or pure functions) can be called directly without cost. Simply click on the function, input any required parameters, and click "Call" to execute the function. The result will be displayed in the console.

### Sending Transactions
For functions that alter the state of the contract (write functions), you’ll need to send a transaction. After inputting the required parameters, click "Transact".
