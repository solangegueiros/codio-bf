### GetInfo
|||


The blue buttons are functions that are read-only. They do not change anything stored on the Blockchain, so you do not need to expend gas when using them.

Functions that don’t require a transaction (view or pure functions) can be called directly without cost.   
Simply click on the button with the function name: “GetInfo”.   
The result will be displayed in the console.

It has not stored any info in the smart contract yet so the result will be… nothing\!
