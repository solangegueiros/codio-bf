## What is ABI (Application Binary Interface)?

You interacted with the smart contract deployed because you have the source code available.

You can interact with any smart contract already deployed in a blockchain network if you have two pieces of information:  
1- The smart contract address  
2- The ABI (Application Binary Interface)

The ABI, or Application Binary Interface, defines how to interact with a smart contract.   
It includes information about the contract's functions, inputs and outputs, events, and other interaction points.  
The ABI is the standard way to interact with smart contracts in the Ethereum ecosystem, both from outside the blockchain and for contract-to-contract interaction.
