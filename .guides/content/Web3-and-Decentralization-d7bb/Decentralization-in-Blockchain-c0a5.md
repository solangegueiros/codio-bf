# Web evolution and the Decentralization role

## Decentralization and its role in blockchain technology

Decentralization is a fundamental principle of blockchain technology. Instead of relying on a single central authority, control is distributed across a network of computers (nodes). This distribution reduces the risk of corruption and system failures, as no single entity can control or alter the data. This decentralized approach enhances security and trust among participants.  
Let us explore why decentralization is crucial and how it benefits the blockchain ecosystem.
