## Web Evolution and Web3

### Web 1.0

The original design of the internet. The general workflow of the web was that servers would provide content to individuals consuming content in their browsing session.

### Web 2.0

Web 2.0 (also known as participative web and social web) refers to websites that emphasize user-generated content, ease of use, participatory culture, and interoperability (i.e., compatibility with other products, systems, and devices) for end users.

### Web 3.0

Web3 (also known as Web 3.0) is a marketing term that uses the World Wide Web and incorporates concepts such as decentralization, blockchain technologies, and token-based economics, all of which existed on the Web prior to the term being created. Some technologists and journalists have contrasted it with Web 2.0, saying data and content are centralized in a small group of companies sometimes referred to as "Big Tech." The term "Web3" was coined in 2014 by Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood, and the idea gained interest in 2021 from cryptocurrency enthusiasts, large technology companies, and venture capital firms. The concepts of Web3 were first presented in 2013\.
