You will then be moved to a confirmation screen that has several useful pieces of information: the asset you are trying to send (Token, NFT, etc.), the amount, and the estimated transaction fee.

After entering an amount of SepoliaETH to send to your 2nd wallet, you will see a confirmation screen that shows the amount you are sending, the estimated fee, and a confirmation button. Upon clicking this button, you will initiate the transaction.
