## Transfers using an Ethereum wallet 

|||


The simplest way to understand the end-to-end transaction process is to send coins to yourself from the first account to the second account just created in the previous step.

First, you must have some test tokens.

If you don't have it, go to the topic lesson **Faucets: obtaining testnet tokens.**

### Send 0.00001 SepoliaETH from Account 1 to Account 2

In your MetaMask extension, you can select the Send button to initiate a transaction.

#### MetaMask browser popup

After selecting Send, you will be asked the public address of the account to which you want to send the tokens. 

For this exercise, select the 2nd account created (or the one that doesn't have tokens) to receive the test tokens.

You will then be moved to a confirmation screen that has several useful pieces of information: the asset you are trying to send (Token, NFT, etc.), the amount, and the estimated transaction fee.

After entering an amount of SepoliaETH to send to your 2nd wallet, you will see a confirmation screen that shows the amount you are sending, the estimated fee, and a confirmation button. Upon clicking this button, you will initiate the transaction.

While the transaction is reaching finality, you can monitor it in your transaction history at the bottom of your MetaMask Extension.

Once the transaction is complete, you can view more information in your MetaMask extension by selecting the transaction.
