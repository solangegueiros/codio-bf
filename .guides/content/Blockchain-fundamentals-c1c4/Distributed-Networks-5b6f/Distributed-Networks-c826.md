## Distributed Networks

Peer-to-peer (P2P) computing or networking is a distributed application architecture that partitions tasks or workloads between peers.

The diagrams of Paul Baran, published in the text On distributed communications (BARAN, Paul \- 1964), are one of the best ways to present distributed networks:

This is the basic concept of Blockchain: p2p, peer-to-peer or peer-to-peer networks in which communication can be carried out between any pair of computers.

### Centralized Networks 

A system in which a single, centrally owned, or controlled server (node) is entrusted with processing data to and from peripheral nodes. This can be diagrammed similarly to a wheel where a single node acts as an axil that sends messages of the "spokes" to the outside of the wheel.

### Decentralized Networks

Peer-to-peer networks, where no entity controls an effective or controlling number of the network nodes, run on open source software, which is also not controlled by any entity, are said to affect a decentralized network protocol. These networks are harder for outside actors to shut down as they have no central headquarters

### Distributed Networks

A network configuration where every participant can communicate with one another without going through a centralized point. Since there are multiple pathways for communication, the loss of any participant will not prevent communication. This is also known as a peer-to-peer network as they're decentralized.
