### Game Theory

|||



Game theory is the study of mathematical models of strategic interactions among rational agents. It has applications in many social science fields, and it is used extensively in economics as well as in logic, systems science, and computer science. Traditional game theory addresses two-person zero-sum games in which a participant's gains or losses are balanced by the losses and gains of the other participant. In the 21st century, game theory applies to a wider range of behavioral relations. It is now an umbrella term for the science of rational decision-making in humans, animals, and computers.
