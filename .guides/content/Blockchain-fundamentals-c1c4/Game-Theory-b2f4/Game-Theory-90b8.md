### Game Theory

|||


Game theory is the study of [mathematical models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical\_model) of strategic interactions among [rational agents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational\_agent). It has applications in many fields of [social science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social\_science), used extensively in economics as well as in [logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic), [systems science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems\_science) and [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer\_science). Traditional game theory addressed two-person [zero-sum games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-sum\_game), in which a participant's gains or losses are exactly balanced by the losses and gains of the other participant. In the 21st century, game theory applies to a wider range of [behavioral relations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human\_behavior), and it is now an [umbrella term](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbrella\_term) for the [science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science) of rational [decision making](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making) in humans, animals, as well as computers.
