When we are talking about game theory, we are not talking about video games or board games.  
It is the study of decision making between individuals when the outcome of each depends on the decisions of the others in a game-like interdependence.

In Blockchain, game theory is how will be the interactions between participants in the blockchain ecosystem and their incentives to behave honestly.
