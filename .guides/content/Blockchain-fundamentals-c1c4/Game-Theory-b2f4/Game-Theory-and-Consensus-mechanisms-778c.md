## Game Theory and Consensus mechanisms (PoW, PoS, PoA)

Game theory is not related to video or board games.  
It is the study of decision-making between individuals when the outcome of each depends on the decisions of the others in a game-like interdependence.  
In other words, it is the study of probabilities in decision-making.

In Blockchain, game theory is how the interactions between participants in the blockchain ecosystem happen and their incentives to behave honestly.
