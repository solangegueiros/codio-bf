### Proof of Authority (PoA)

Proof of Authority provides another alternative to PoW and PoS systems. It is a consensus algorithm suitable for private and permissioned blockchains which relies on a number of pre-chosen authoritative nodes called the validators. (Singh et al., 2020a)

Group of Authorities:  
These authorities are the validators checking whether new transactions align with the networkâ€™s rules and ensure that the sender has adequate funds to complete the transaction. Specific nodes are defined and authorized to create new blocks in a chain. It needs approval from most of the nodes for the block to be created

This is used in permissioned blockchains, private Ethereum networks, and others.
