### Consensus

It is a mechanism to ensure that all parties agree that a certain state of the system is correct.  
Consensus mechanisms are based on game theory.

### Consensus Mechanisms in Blockchain

Consensus mechanisms are the protocols that all participants in a blockchain network follow to maintain the integrity, security, and smooth operation of a blockchain. They ensure that all nodes in the network agree on the state of the blockchain, preventing fraud and errors.

A Byzantine fault (also Byzantine generals problem, interactive consistency, source congruency, error avalanche, Byzantine agreement problem, and Byzantine failure) is a condition of a computer system, particularly distributed computing systems, where components may fail and there is imperfect information on whether a component has failed. The term takes its name from an allegory, the "Byzantine generals problem," developed to describe a situation in which the system's actors must agree on a concerted strategy to avoid catastrophic failure of the system. The issue is that some of these actors are unreliable.

Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BTF) refers to the ability of a distributed system (like a blockchain network) to continue operating correctly even when some of its nodes (participants) fail or act maliciously.

In the blockchain context, BFT is crucial because blockchains are decentralized and involve multiple nodes that need to agree on a single version of the truth. A BFT consensus mechanism ensures that the network can reach consensus despite the presence of faulty or malicious nodes.

Some consensus types used in Blockchains:

* Proof of Work (PoW)  
* Proof of Stake (PoS)  
* Proof of Authority (PoA)
