### Proof of Work (PoW)

Proof of Work is the consensus algorithm intended to provide incentives for responsible behavior for blockchain transactions.

* Concept by Cynthia Dwork and Moni Naor in 1992 in the paper "Pricing Via Processing, Or, Combatting Junk Mail, Advances in Cryptology"  
* Named by Markus Jakobsson and Ari Juels in 1999 in the paper: "Proofs of Work and Bread Pudding Protocols"

PoW ensures that participants in the network agree on the state of the ledger (i.e., the order and validity of the transactions) through a process that involves solving complex cryptographic puzzles.

### Mining

"Miners" do mathematical calculations on their computers to verify that transactions are valid. Mining comes from trial and error of finding a nonce (random number) that satisfies the degree of difficulty of the network

Difficulty ensures that the process of adding new blocks to the blockchain requires a significant amount of computational work. This makes it economically infeasible for malicious actors to manipulate the blockchain.

Asymmetry

* Requires a significant amount of computational effort to solve a puzzle or perform a certain task  
* Verifying that the work has been done in a relatively simple and quick manner
