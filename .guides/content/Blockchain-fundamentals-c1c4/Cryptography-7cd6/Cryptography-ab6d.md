In Greek: kryptós, "hidden," and gráphein, "written."

The provable method to establish trust in a transaction.  
[Cryptography](https://blog.chain.link/what-is-cryptographic-truth/) is the study of the principles and techniques by which information can be transformed from its original form to one that is not human-readable.

* Information can be known only to its recipient (holder of the "secret key")  
* Difficult to read by an unauthorized person  
* Only the recipient of the message can read the information easily

It is a branch of mathematics, part of cryptology.

Modern cryptography is fundamental to aspects of information security:

* Confidentiality  
* Data integrity  
* Authentication  
* Non-repudiation

Let's understand:

* Hash function  
* Cryptographic keys  
* Public key and private key  
* Merkle tree
