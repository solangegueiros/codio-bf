### Hash Function

|||


Algorithm that maps variable-length data to fixed-length data.

Characteristics:

* Deterministic—the same entry will always result in the same exit  
* Fast  
* One way—from the hash it is not possible to return to the original  
* A small change in the input generates a completely different hash (it seems random)  
* Collision resistant—two documents do not generate the same hash

A hash function is any function that can be used to map data of arbitrary size to fixed-size values, though there are some hash functions that support variable length output. The values returned by a hash function are called hash values, hash codes, hash digests, digests, or simply hashes. The values are usually used to index a fixed-size table called a hash table. Use of a hash function to index a hash table is called hashing or scatter storage addressing.
