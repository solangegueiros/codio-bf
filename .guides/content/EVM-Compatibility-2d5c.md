## EVM Compatibility

|||


EVM, or Ethereum Virtual Machine, compatibility refers to the ability of a blockchain network to support the same tools, languages, and standards as Ethereum, allowing it to run [smart contracts](https://chain.link/education/smart-contracts) and decentralized applications (dApps) designed for Ethereum. EVM compatibility is a critical feature for many developers, allowing them to leverage their existing knowledge and tools to build on these networks.
