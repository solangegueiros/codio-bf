### Wallets groups: software, hardware, and paper

Crypto wallets can be classified into three groups: software, hardware, and paper wallets.

#### Software wallet

The majority of crypto wallet providers are software-based.  
It can also be classified into desktop, mobile, and web wallets.

* Desktop: software installed on your computer, which you download and execute locally on your machine.  
* Mobile: a software known by an app installed on your smartphone. These are convenient as they allow you to send and receive crypto using QR codes.  
* Web: there are two types:  
  * Browser extension: installed in your browser.  
  * Web site: accessed through a browser interface without downloading or installing anything.

In this course, web browser extension wallets are used. They store your keys locally, on your computer.

Some service providers hold and manage the private keys on your behalf. Although this may be more convenient for inexperienced users, it's a dangerous practice\! If you don't hold your private keys, you're trusting your money to someone else.

There is a popular phrase related to this:

**Not your keys, not your coins\!**

### Hardware wallet

Hardware wallets are physical, electronic devices that store your keys, generate addresses, and create transactions.

Some use a random number generator (RNG) to generate public and private keys. The keys are then stored on a device that isn't connected to the Internet.

Other hardware wallets can be connected to the Internet only when you are creating and sending a transaction.

Software wallets are more convenient than hardware wallets. However, hardware wallets tend to be the most secure alternative.

If you plan to hold your cryptocurrency for a long time or if you're holding large amounts of it, you should consider using a hardware wallet.

### Paper Wallet

A paper wallet consists of a "wallet" printed out on a piece of paper.

It is a piece of paper on which a crypto address and its private key are physically printed out in the form of QR codes. These codes can then be scanned to execute cryptocurrency transactions.

Paper wallets are useful for understanding the concepts of public and private keys. They are often used in events to teach these first concepts, but their use is now deemed obsolete and unreliable.

### Wallet types: hot or cold

Crypto wallets may also be called hot or cold wallets, depending on their working mechanisms.

#### Hot wallet

A hot wallet is any wallet that is connected to the Internet all the time.

Most software wallets are hot wallets connected to the Internet.

* Online Storage: Hot wallets are connected to the Internet, which makes them more convenient for daily transactions but also makes them more vulnerable to online attacks.  
* Types: These include mobile wallets, desktop wallets, and web wallets.  
* Use Case: Suitable for frequent transactions, blockchain interaction, and active trading. They provide easy access to funds but require robust security measures.

#### Cold wallet

On the other hand, cold wallets do not have an Internet connection. Instead, they use a physical medium to store the keys offline, making them resistant to online hacking attempts.

Hardware storage is a type of cold wallet that is one of the most secure alternatives.

So, cold wallets are a safer alternative to "storing" your coins. Long-term investors or HODLers use this method.

To resume:

* Offline Storage: Cold wallets are not connected to the internet, making them highly secure against online threats such as hacking and malware.  
* Types: Common types include hardware wallets (physical devices like USB sticks) and paper wallets (printed copies of private keys).  
* Use Case: They are ideal for long-term storage of large amounts of cryptocurrency. They are less convenient for frequent transactions but offer maximum security.

### Multisig wallet

A Multisig wallet is a wallet that needs more than one signature (or approval) to send a transaction, such as transferring cryptos.

Some service providers offer shared control of wallets; they can know one key, and you and others can know other keys. It must have more than one key to send a transaction.

It's important to check the technical approach of each wallet before choosing the most suitable for you.
