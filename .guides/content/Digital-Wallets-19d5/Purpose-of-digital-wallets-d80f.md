# Purpose and types of digital wallets

## Definition and purpose of digital wallets
|||


Most people use digital wallets to handle their digital assets and identity.

The primary function of a digital wallet is to interact with the blockchain, meaning it does not store value within itself. Instead, the value is stored on the blockchain. 

Your wallet is a tool for interacting with your blockchain account. That means you can swap wallet providers at any time. Many wallets also let you manage several blockchain accounts from one application.

Wallet providers don't have custody of your funds. They only allow you to see your assets and provide management tools.  
Cryptocurrencies and tokens never leave the blockchain. They are just transferred from one address to another.

Resume:

* Key manager used to manage your cryptocurrencies or tokens on blockchain  
* Authorize transactions and interact with web pages or decentralized applications  
* Subscribe to messages demonstrating that you own a wallet address
