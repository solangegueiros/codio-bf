It can also be classified into desktop, mobile, and web wallets.

* Desktop: software installed on your computer, which you download and execute locally on your machine.  
* Mobile: a software known by an app installed on your smartphone. These are convenient as they allow you to send and receive crypto using QR codes.  
* Web: there are two types:  
  * Browser extension: installed in your browser.  
  * Web site: accessed through a browser interface without downloading or installing anything.

In this course, web browser extension wallets are used. They store your keys locally, on your computer.

Some service providers hold and manage the private keys on your behalf. Although this may be more convenient for inexperienced users, it's a dangerous practice\! If you don't hold your private keys, you're trusting your money to someone else.
