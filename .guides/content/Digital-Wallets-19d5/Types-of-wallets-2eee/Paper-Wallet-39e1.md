#### Paper Wallet

|||


A paper wallet consists of a "wallet" printed out on a piece of paper.

It is a piece of paper on which a crypto address and its private key are physically printed out in the form of QR codes. These codes can then be scanned to execute cryptocurrency transactions.

Paper wallets are useful for understanding the concepts of public and private keys. They are often used in events to teach these first concepts, but their use is now deemed obsolete and unreliable.
