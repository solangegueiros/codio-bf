#### Hardware wallet

|||


Hardware wallets are physical, electronic devices that store your keys, generate addresses, and create transactions.

Some use a random number generator (RNG) to generate public and private keys. The keys are then stored on a device that isn't connected to the Internet.

Other hardware wallets can be connected to the Internet only when you are creating and sending a transaction.

Software wallets are more convenient than hardware wallets. However, hardware wallets tend to be the most secure alternative.

If you plan to hold your cryptocurrency for a long time or if you're holding large amounts of it, you should consider using a hardware wallet.
