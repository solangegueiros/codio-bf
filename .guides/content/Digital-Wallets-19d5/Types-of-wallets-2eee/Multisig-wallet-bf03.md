### Multisig wallet

|||


A Multisig wallet is a wallet that needs more than one signature (or approval) to send a transaction, such as transferring cryptos.

Some service providers offer shared control of wallets; they can know one key, and you and others can know other keys. It must have more than one key to send a transaction.

It's important to check the technical approach of each wallet before choosing the most suitable for you.
