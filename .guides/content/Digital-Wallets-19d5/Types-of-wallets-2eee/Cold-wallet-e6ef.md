#### Cold wallet

|||


On the other hand, cold wallets do not have an Internet connection. Instead, they use a physical medium to store the keys offline, making them resistant to online hacking attempts.

Hardware storage is a type of cold wallet that is one of the most secure alternatives.

So, cold wallets are a safer alternative to "storing" your coins. Long-term investors or HODLers use this method.

To resume:

* Offline Storage: Cold wallets are not connected to the internet, making them highly secure against online threats such as hacking and malware.  
* Types: Common types include hardware wallets (physical devices like USB sticks) and paper wallets (printed copies of private keys).  
* Use Case: They are ideal for long-term storage of large amounts of cryptocurrency. They are less convenient for frequent transactions but offer maximum security.
