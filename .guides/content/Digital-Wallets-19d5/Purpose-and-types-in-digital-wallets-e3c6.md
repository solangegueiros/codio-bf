# Purpose and types of digital wallets

|||

People rely on wallets to keep their valuables secure daily, from money to identification. A digital wallet serves a similar purpose in the digital world. It allows us to store various assets, such as crypto assets (digital money), our identity (represented by non-fungible tokens), membership cards, digital certificates, and more.

## Definition and purpose of digital wallets

A digital or crypto wallet is a key manager that allows you to manage your cryptocurrencies. You can check the balance and store, receive, or transfer crypto. Furthermore, they allow you to sign messages, proving that you own an address associated with your wallet. The most common are computer or mobile applications.

Wallets are applications that give you control over your account. “Like your physical wallet, it contains everything you need to prove your identity and handle your assets. Your wallet allows you to sign in to applications, read your balance, send transactions, and verify your identity.” (Ethereum wallets | ethereum.org. https://ethereum.org/ta/wallets/)

Most people use digital wallets to handle their digital assets and identity.

The primary function of a digital wallet is to interact with the blockchain, meaning it does not store value within itself. Instead, the value is stored on the blockchain. 

Your wallet is a tool for interacting with your blockchain account. That means you can swap wallet providers at any time. Many wallets also let you manage several blockchain accounts from one application.

Wallet providers don't have custody of your funds. They only allow you to see your assets and provide management tools.  
Cryptocurrencies and tokens never leave the blockchain. They are just transferred from one address to another.
