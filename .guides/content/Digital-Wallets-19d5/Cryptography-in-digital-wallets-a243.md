## Cryptography in digital wallets

|||

A digital wallet is based on public and private keys, which can be generated using a mnemonic phrase. 

### Public key

A public key generates addresses for several blockchains.

These addresses can be shared with anyone who will send you cryptocurrency.

### Private key

The private key, as the name implies, is to be private and must be kept confidential.

Anyone who knows the private key is able to prove they own the cryptocurrency on that account and can send them to others.

The private key gives access to your cryptocurrencies, regardless of which wallet you use. So, even if your computer or smartphone gets compromised, you can still access your funds on another device if you have the corresponding private key (or seed phrase).

**Never share your private keys or a mnemonic phrase. Someone with your private key can perform transactions on your behalf, including spending your tokens.**

### Address

Crypto wallets also include one or more addresses.

An address is an alphanumeric identifier generated based on the public/private keys. It can be defined as a specific "location" on the blockchain to which coins can be sent to.

You can share your address with others to receive funds.

### Mnemonic

It is possible to generate a single address from a key pair, but wallets often use a mnemonic as the basis for generating several key pairs.

A mnemonic is a set of predefined words generated from a list. Usually with 12 or 24 words.

Anyone who knows a mnemonic can access and transfer all cryptos from all addresses generated from this mnemonic.

If you lose your wallet, you can use the mnemonic and set it up again in another application, computer, or cell phone.

You can even use the same mnemonic in different wallets.

**Attention: the mnemonic is the most important part of a wallet\!**

If you forgot or lost your mnemonic, you will have no backup of your wallet.

If something like this happens, but you still have access to the wallet, I strongly recommend transferring all cryptos immediately to another wallet (another mnemonic) before any catastrophe happens to it.

Mnemonic is also known as a:

* seed  
* seed phrase  
* recovery phrase  
* backup phrase

**Never share your mnemonic phrases or private keys. If someone has your mnemonic, they can perform transactions on your behalf, including spending your tokens.**

### Crypto vs bank account

Making an analogy to a bank account:

* The public key represents your account data: bank, branch, and account number.  
* To receive money from someone, you will disclose your account details.  
* The private key is your password. You don't tell anyone and only you can use it to withdraw funds.

There is a difference between cryptos and the banking environment: if a person knows your account details in a bank, they cannot see your balance and transactions.  
However, blockchain is public and transparent, so whoever knows that you are the owner of an address can track your balance and transactions.

Some blockchains are not fully public, they are permissioned, but they will not be covered now.
