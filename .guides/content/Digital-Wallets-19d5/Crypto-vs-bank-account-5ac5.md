### Crypto vs bank account
|||


Making an analogy to a bank account:

* The public key represents your account data: bank, branch, and account number.  
* To receive money from someone, you will disclose your account details.  
* The private key is your password. You don't tell anyone and only you can use it to withdraw funds.

There is a difference between cryptos and the banking environment: if a person knows your account details in a bank, they cannot see your balance and transactions.  
However, blockchain is public and transparent, so whoever knows that you are the owner of an address can track your balance and transactions.

Some blockchains are not fully public, they are permissioned, but they will not be covered now.
