### Mnemonic

|||


It is possible to generate a single address from a key pair, but wallets often use a mnemonic as the basis for generating several key pairs.

A mnemonic is a set of predefined words generated from a list. Usually with 12 or 24 words.

Anyone who knows a mnemonic can access and transfer all cryptos from all addresses generated from this mnemonic.

If you lose your wallet, you can use the mnemonic and set it up again in another application, computer, or cell phone.

You can even use the same mnemonic in different wallets.

## Attention

**The mnemonic is the most important part of a wallet\!**
|||

If you forgot or lost your mnemonic, you will have no backup of your wallet.

If something like this happens, but you still have access to the wallet, I strongly recommend transferring all cryptos immediately to another wallet (another mnemonic) before any catastrophe happens to it.

Mnemonic is also known as a:

* seed  
* seed phrase  
* recovery phrase  
* backup phrase

**Never share your mnemonic phrases or private keys. If someone has your mnemonic, they can perform transactions on your behalf, including spending your tokens.**
