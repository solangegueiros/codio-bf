## Cryptography in digital wallets

|||

A digital wallet is based on public and private keys, which can be generated using a mnemonic phrase. 

### Public key

A public key generates addresses for several blockchains.

These addresses can be shared with anyone who will send you cryptocurrency.


### Address

Crypto wallets also include one or more addresses.

An address is an alphanumeric identifier generated based on the public/private keys. It can be defined as a specific "location" on the blockchain to which coins can be sent to.

You can share your address with others to receive funds.
