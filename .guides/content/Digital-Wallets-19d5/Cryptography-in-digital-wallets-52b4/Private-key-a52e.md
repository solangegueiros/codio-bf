### Private key

|||


The private key, as the name implies, is to be private and must be kept confidential.

Anyone who knows the private key is able to prove they own the cryptocurrency on that account and can send them to others.

The private key gives access to your cryptocurrencies, regardless of which wallet you use. So, even if your computer or smartphone gets compromised, you can still access your funds on another device if you have the corresponding private key (or seed phrase).

**Never share your private keys or a mnemonic phrase. Someone with your private key can perform transactions on your behalf, including spending your tokens.**
