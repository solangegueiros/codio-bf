## Stablecoins

|||


Stablecoins are tokens designed to maintain a stable value relative to a specific asset or basket of assets, typically a fiat currency like the US dollar or euro, or a commodity like gold.

Unlike cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, which can experience significant price volatility, stablecoins aim to provide price stability, making them more suitable for everyday transactions, savings, and as a store of value.

Some stablecoins:

* **Tether (USDT):** One of the oldest and most widely used stablecoins, Tether is pegged to the U.S. dollar at a 1:1 ratio.  
* **USD Coin (USDC):** Another popular stablecoin, USDC, is also pegged to the U.S. dollar and is known for its transparency and regular audits.  
* **USDS:** Unlike USDT and USDC, USDS is a decentralized stablecoin collateralized by other cryptocurrencies rather than fiat currency, and real-world assets.  
* **PAXG (Paxos Gold)**: Pegged to the price of gold, issued by Paxos.
