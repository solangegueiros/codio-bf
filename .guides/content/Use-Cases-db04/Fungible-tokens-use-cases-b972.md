# Identify Token Use Cases

## Fungible Token Use Cases

|||


### Real-World Asset Tokenization

Real-world assets like fiat currency, equities, T-bills, credit, commodities, carbon credits, intellectual property, and fine art can be tokenized and stored on a blockchain. Gold bullion warrants and house deeds are bearer assets that give the holder a claim over a real-world asset. The main difference from legacy bearer assets is that physical asset tokenization enables assets to be stored, traded, and used as collateral across blockchain networks. ‍

### Digital Asset Tokenization

Tokenizing assets that only exist in a digital form on a blockchain network is critical to Web3, especially for use cases such as representing DAO governance rights and cross-chain assets. Because they’re entirely digital, tokenized assets stored on a blockchain enable the owner to hold the asset outright rather than owning a claim on the underlying asset. ‍

### In-Game Asset Tokenization

A subset of digital asset tokenization, in-game assets used in GameFi projects or metaverses, such as skins, weapons, or in-game currencies, can be represented as tokenized assets.
