## NFT Use Cases

|||


### Digital Art NFTs

One of the most recognized NFT use cases is tokenized ownership of digital artwork. By tokenizing their work, artists can monetize their craft and tap into a global market of potential customers who only need an Internet connection to purchase it. Unlike traditional art marketplaces, which are often opaque, value-extracting, limited in discoverability, and require significant listing fees, NFTs can be listed on global, permissionless online marketplaces. They can even provide creators revenue from all secondary sales.

An example of NFT art that made headlines is the famous digital artist Beeple. His piece “[Everydays: The First 5000 Days,](https://onlineonly.christies.com/s/beeple-first-5000-days/beeple-b-1981-1/112924)” a collage of 5,000 images that took 12+ years to create, was tokenized as an NFT on Ethereum and sold for over $69M. Using the popular ERC-721 token standard, Beeple could monetize his digital artwork and establish cryptographic proof that the specific NFT was the official copy. Beeple’s artwork is only one of thousands of digital art collections released and sold worldwide as NFTs.

### Collectibles

Collectibles: NFTs can represent unique collectibles, such as trading cards, virtual pets, or rare in-game items.

Similar to collecting physical trading cards or mail stamps, NFTs empower a new type of digital collectible. Collectors can buy digital objects they deem valuable or signal their support for a specific company, brand, game, or artist. Unlike physical collectibles that can be slow to transport and expensive to maintain, NFTs have no such restraints as they are entirely digital, transferrable in seconds, and never degrade in quality.  
Some of the most recognized NFT collectibles are [CryptoPunks](https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks), an algorithmically generated collection of 10,000 unique 8-bit-style characters, so no two characters are exactly alike. CryptoPunks were some of the first NFTs ever created and were given away for free. They continue to attract users who want to own an original piece of NFT history.  
Collectible NFTs are increasingly used as profile pictures on social media platforms like X and Discord. Doing so provides a powerful signaling mechanism where individuals can display their interest in an NFT collection and join a community of like-minded individuals.

### Gaming

NFTs are a foundational component of [blockchain-based video games](https://blog.chain.link/nft-games/) because they allow unique in-game items to be tokenized, tracked, and transferred in a non-custodial manner. With traditional online video games, centralized publishers have complete control over the distribution, ownership, and attributes of in-game items that often determine the value of certain characters and game outcomes. If the publisher shuts down, users lose access to all the game items they potentially spent hours, days, weeks, or even longer acquiring.

NFTs ensure users have complete control over their game items and enable entirely new gaming possibilities. This includes the creation of an interoperable metaverse—where the items from one game can be used and traded in another, and even marketplaces for [lending and renting](https://blog.chain.link/nft-lending-renting-blockchain-games/) various game NFTs. 

The implementation of gaming NFTs varies across games, from tokenizing cosmetic skins in MOBA and FPS games and characters in MMORPGs to creating general community membership NFTs that provide holders with early access to new game features, governance power to help shape a game’s direction, and more.

In-game assets: NFTs can represent unique in-game items, such as weapons, skins, or characters, which players can trade or sell outside the game environment.

Virtual real estate: Players can own and trade virtual land or properties within a game, creating a virtual economy.

### Real Estate

NFTs can also represent ownership of real-world assets like real estate to introduce additional liquidity into traditionally fragmented markets. [Tokenizing real estate](https://chain.link/education-hub/tokenized-real-estate) increases the efficiency of transferring ownership and provides a single source of truth around the authenticity and provenance of a specific property. The concept of [tokenizing real-world assets](https://chain.link/education-hub/how-to-tokenize-an-asset) can be expanded to include many asset types, such as physical paintings, government documents, certifications, and diplomas.

While still in the early stages, real-world assets tokenized as NFTs enable several new possibilities, from revenue-generating real-estate tokens backed by rental income to issuing digital credentials without needing a physical document counterpart. They can also digitize existing records like educational diplomas and intellectual property contracts, leading to more credentials transparency and new forms of automation.

### Fractional Ownership

Investors can buy fractions of a property, making real estate investment more accessible and liquid.

### Intellectual Property

Patents and trademarks: NFTs can be used to tokenize intellectual property rights, making it easier to license, transfer, and enforce these rights.

### Identity verification

Digital identities: NFTs can be used to create verifiable digital identities, which can be used for secure access to online services or as proof of identity.

### Event Tickets

Ticketing: NFTs can represent event tickets, ensuring authenticity and preventing fraud. These tickets can be easily transferred or resold on secondary markets.

### Supply Chain

Product provenance: NFTs can track products' origin and history, ensuring transparency and authenticity in the supply chain.
