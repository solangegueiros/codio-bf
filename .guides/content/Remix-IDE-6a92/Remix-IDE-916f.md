## What Is the Remix IDE (Integrated Development Environment)?

[Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) has several features that are out of the box and facilitate the quick development of smart contracts. 

In this guide, the IDE's features​​ that will help you get going quickly will be highlighted, but feel free to reference the [documentation](https://remix-ide.readthedocs.io/) for further features, plugins, and community support.

Remix is a web-based Integrated Development Environment (IDE) designed for writing, testing, debugging, and deploying smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. Developed by the Ethereum Foundation, Remix is an essential tool for novice and experienced developers building dApps and smart contracts.

Let´s learn some useful Remix parts in this course and configure them.

For this workshop, you will be utilizing:

* File Explorer (Workspaces)  
* Terminal  
* Solidity Compiler  
* Deploy & Run transactions

### File Explorer (Workspaces)

The File Explorer (Workspaces) allows you to view your code's directory/tree structure on the left side of the screen. This portion houses our raw Solidity code; all smart contracts created will appear here.  
When you first open Remix, you will be in the default\_workspace, and some files and folders will already be there.  
You can create workspaces for different projects, but let's stay in the default workspace for now.
