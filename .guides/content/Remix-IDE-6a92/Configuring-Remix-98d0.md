## Configuring Remix

|||


### Open Remix

Go to [remix.ethereum.org](https://remix.ethereum.org/) 

### Solidity Compiler

The Solidity Compiler allows us to select when and how the code should be converted from human-readable to machine-readable. 

**Open the Solidity Compiler:** On the left sidebar, click the "Solidity Compiler" icon, which looks like a small S.

It is helpful to enable the **auto-compile** in order to compile smart contracts automatically while editing in Remix.

**Your settings are saved\!** Once you’ve enabled “auto compile” or made any update, Remix will remember these settings for your session. There’s no need to save manually; your settings will be applied as you work.

### Deploy & Run Transactions

After compiling the source code, this tab allows you to easily publish the smart contract to the testnet and interact with the functions in our smart contract.

In the left sidebar of Remix, click on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" icon, which looks like an Ethereum diamond.
