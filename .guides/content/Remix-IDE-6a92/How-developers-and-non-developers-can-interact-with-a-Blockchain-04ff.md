## How Developers and Non-Developers Can Interact With a Blockchain

Both developers and non-developers have various options for interacting with a blockchain. 

Here are some options to engage:

### Blockchain Explorers

Block explorers are portals to blockchains. They usually have a query field where you can look for addresses, blocks, smart contracts, and transactions.

In this lesson, you will use [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/), a popular Ethereum block explorer. It allows developers and non-developers to search for transactions, view smart contract source code, and monitor the blockchain in real time.

### Remix IDE

[Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) is a powerful online IDE (Integrated Development Environment) that allows developers to write, compile, and deploy smart contracts in Solidity. Itâ€™s particularly user-friendly for those new to blockchain development. You will use Remix during this course.
