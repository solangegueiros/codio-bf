## Token Standards and Their Purposes: ERC-20, ERC-721 (NFTs)

### ERC-20

|||


[ERC-20](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/) is the most common standard for creating fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain.   
It defines a set of rules and functionalities a smart contract must implement to create and manage tokens compatible with the Ethereum ecosystem.  
ERC-20 tokens are primarily used to create cryptocurrencies, utility tokens, and other digital assets where uniformity is essential.

Key characteristics of ERC-20 tokens:

**Fungibility**: ERC-20 tokens are fungible, meaning each token is identical and interchangeable with any other token of the same type. This makes them suitable for use as a medium of exchange, a unit of account, or a store of value.

**Interoperability**: Because ERC-20 is a standard, any token that follows this standard can be easily integrated with other Ethereum-based applications, including wallets, exchanges, and dApps. This ensures that ERC-20 tokens are widely compatible within the Ethereum ecosystem.

**Divisibility**: ERC-20 tokens can typically be divided into smaller units, allowing for precise transactions. For example, a token might have 18 decimal places, meaning the most minor and indivisible part is the 18th decimal place.

**Smart contract-based**: ERC-20 tokens are created and managed by smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. These contracts handle the creation, transfer, and management of the tokens according to the rules defined in the contract.
