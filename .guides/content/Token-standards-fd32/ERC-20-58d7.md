## Token Standards and Their Purposes: ERC-20, ERC-721 (NFTs)

### ERC-20

|||


[ERC-20](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/) is the most common standard for creating fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain.   
It defines a set of rules and functionalities a smart contract must implement to create and manage tokens compatible with the Ethereum ecosystem.  
ERC-20 tokens are primarily used to create cryptocurrencies, utility tokens, and other digital assets where uniformity is essential.

Key characteristics of ERC-20 tokens:

**Fungibility**: ERC-20 tokens are fungible, meaning each token is identical and interchangeable with any other token of the same type. This makes them suitable for use as a medium of exchange, a unit of account, or a store of value.

**Interoperability**: Because ERC-20 is a standard, any token that follows this standard can be easily integrated with other Ethereum-based applications, including wallets, exchanges, and dApps. This ensures that ERC-20 tokens are widely compatible within the Ethereum ecosystem.

**Divisibility**: ERC-20 tokens can typically be divided into smaller units, allowing for precise transactions. For example, a token might have 18 decimal places, meaning the most minor and indivisible part is the 18th decimal place.

**Smart contract-based**: ERC-20 tokens are created and managed by smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. These contracts handle the creation, transfer, and management of the tokens according to the rules defined in the contract.

#### Smart Contract Definition

If a smart contract implements the following methods and events, it can be called an ERC-20 token contract. Once deployed, it will be responsible for keeping track of the tokens created on Ethereum.  
If a token is an ERC-20 token, it must have the following functions and events. Even if they are not implemented, they must be declared.

From [EIP-20](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20):

**Functions:**

1. **`totalSupply`**:  
   * Returns the total supply of tokens that exist.  
2. **`balanceOf(address account)`**:  
   * Returns the balance of tokens for a specific address.  
3. **`transfer(address recipient, uint256 amount)`**:  
   * Transfers a specified token amount from the senderâ€™s account to another account.  
4. **`approve(address spender, uint256 amount)`**:  
   * Approves a spender to transfer up to a specified amount of tokens on behalf of the owner.  
5. **`allowance(address owner, address spender)`**:  
   * Returns the remaining number of tokens that the spender is allowed to spend on behalf of the owner.  
6. **`transferFrom(address sender, address recipient, uint256 amount)`**:  
   * Transfers tokens from one account to another, typically used in conjunction with `approve` and `allowance` to manage delegated transfers.

**Events:**

* **`Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 value)`**:  
  * Emitted when tokens are transferred, including zero-value transfers.  
* **`Approval(address indexed owner, address indexed spender, uint256 value)`**:  
  * Emitted when the approve function sets an `approval`.
