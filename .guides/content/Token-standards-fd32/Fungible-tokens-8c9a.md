Assets with fungibility mean that each unit is identical, interchangeable, and divisible. Fungible assets like the US dollar, bitcoin, and even company reward points are used every day. 

Fungible tokens are interchangeable, and each unit has an identical value and function. Making them ideal for use in financial transactions, as currency, or in trading and settlement. Their fungibility ensures that each token is equal in value and function to any other token of the same type, which is fundamental to their role in the digital economy.
