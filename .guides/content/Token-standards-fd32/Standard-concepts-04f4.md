# Token Standards

## Standard Concepts

|||


A standard in technology and engineering is a set of agreed-upon norms, rules, or guidelines that specify how something should be designed, implemented, or used.   
Standards are developed to ensure consistency, compatibility, and interoperability across different systems, products, or services.

A standard is not an obligation to be followed; it is a choice\!  
But if you say that your token follows a standard, other people will expect to find specific functions in your token, and you should declare them, even if you do not implement their definitions.
