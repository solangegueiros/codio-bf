## Token Standards and Their Purposes: ERC-20, ERC-721 (NFTs)

### ERC-721

|||


ERC-721 is the standard for creating non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Ethereum blockchain.   
Unlike ERC-20, ERC-721 tokens are unique and cannot be exchanged one-to-one. 

Each ERC-721 token represents a distinct asset, making this standard ideal for digital art, collectibles, real estate, and other assets where uniqueness and individuality are essential.

Key characteristics of ERC-721: 

**Non-fungible**: Each ERC-721 token is unique, with a distinct identifier (usually a `uint256` token ID). This uniqueness differentiates ERC-721 tokens from ERC-20 tokens, where each unit is identical.

**Ownership**: ERC-721 tokens track ownership of specific assets. The standard includes functions to transfer ownership, approve others to transfer tokens on your behalf, and query ownership details.

**Metadata**: ERC-721 tokens can include metadata that describes the assets they represent. This metadata is often a URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) that points to additional data, such as digital artwork, game items, or other unique items.

**Interoperability**: As a standard, ERC-721 ensures that any tokens created using this standard can be recognized and used by other smart contracts, wallets, and applications that support ERC-721, enabling a broad ecosystem for NFTs.

#### Smart Contract Definition

If a smart contract implements the following methods and events, it can be called an ERC-721 token contract. Once deployed, it will be responsible for keeping track of the tokens created on Ethereum.  
If a token is an ERC-721 token, it must have the following functions and events. Even if they are not implemented, they must be declared.

From [EIP-721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721):

**Functions:**

**`balanceOf(address owner)`**: Returns the number of tokens owned by a specific address.

**`ownerOf(uint256 tokenId)`**: Returns the owner of a specific token by its ID.

**`safeTransferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId)`**: Safely transfers token ownership from one address to another, ensuring the recipient can handle ERC-721 tokens.

**`transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId)`**: Transfers token ownership without safety checks (not recommended for general use).

**`approve(address to, uint256 tokenId)`**: Approves another address to transfer a specific token on behalf of the owner.

**`getApproved(uint256 tokenId)`**: Returns the address approved for a specific token.

**`setApprovalForAll(address operator, bool approved)`**: Approves or removes an operator as authorized to manage all of the sender's assets.

**`isApprovedForAll(address owner, address operator)`**: Checks if an operator is approved to manage all assets of a specific owner.

**Events**:

**`Transfer(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId)`**: Emitted when ownership of a token changes.

**`Approval(address owner, address approved, uint256 tokenId)`**: Emitted when the approval for a specific token is set or changed.

**`ApprovalForAll(address owner, address operator, bool approved)`**: Emitted when the approval status for all tokens owned by an address is set or changed.
