## Token Standards and Their Purposes: ERC-20, ERC-721 (NFTs)

### ERC-721

|||


ERC-721 is the standard for creating non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Ethereum blockchain.   
Unlike ERC-20, ERC-721 tokens are unique and cannot be exchanged one-to-one. 

Each ERC-721 token represents a distinct asset, making this standard ideal for digital art, collectibles, real estate, and other assets where uniqueness and individuality are essential.

Key characteristics of ERC-721: 

**Non-fungible**: Each ERC-721 token is unique, with a distinct identifier (usually a `uint256` token ID). This uniqueness differentiates ERC-721 tokens from ERC-20 tokens, where each unit is identical.

**Ownership**: ERC-721 tokens track ownership of specific assets. The standard includes functions to transfer ownership, approve others to transfer tokens on your behalf, and query ownership details.

**Metadata**: ERC-721 tokens can include metadata that describes the assets they represent. This metadata is often a URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) that points to additional data, such as digital artwork, game items, or other unique items.

**Interoperability**: As a standard, ERC-721 ensures that any tokens created using this standard can be recognized and used by other smart contracts, wallets, and applications that support ERC-721, enabling a broad ecosystem for NFTs.
