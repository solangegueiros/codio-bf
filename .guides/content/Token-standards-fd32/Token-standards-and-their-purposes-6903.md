## Token Standards and Their Purposes: ERC-20, ERC-721 (NFTs)

|||


Token standards are rules or guidelines that define how tokens are created, managed, and interacted with on a blockchain. These standards ensure compatibility across different platforms and wallets, making it easier for developers to build and users to interact with tokens. 

Two of the most widely used token standards on the Ethereum blockchain are:

- ERC-20
- ERC-721
