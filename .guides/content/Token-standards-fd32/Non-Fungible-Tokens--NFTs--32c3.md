## Fungible and Non-Fungible Tokens

### Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)

|||


Non-fungible assets mean that each unit is unique from one to another. 

An [NFT (non-fungible token)](https://chain.link/education/nfts) is a digital token with a unique, one-of-a-kind identifier that differentiates it from any other blockchain token.

An NFT is a unique digital asset representing ownership or proof of authenticity of a specific item or content, typically stored on a blockchain. 

NTFs cannot be exchanged on a like-for-like basis because they can have different values.  
The unique NTF properties, such as indivisibility, interoperability, and verifiability, make them a powerful tool for various applications, such as digital art, collectibles, [music](https://chain.link/education-hub/music-nfts), media, gaming pieces, domain names, or other unique assets.
