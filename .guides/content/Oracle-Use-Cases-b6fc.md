## Oracle Use Cases

|||



Smart contract developers use oracles to build more advanced decentralized applications across broader blockchain use cases. While there are potentially infinite possibilities, the use cases with the most widespread adoption are below.

### Decentralized Finance (DeFi)

DeFi is a massive Blockchain use case, and a large portion of the DeFi ecosystem requires price oracles so that smart contracts can access financial data about assets and markets.   
Decentralized money markets use price oracles to determine users’ borrowing capacity and check if users’ positions are undercollateralized and subject to liquidation. Similarly, synthetic asset platforms use price oracles to peg the value of tokens to real-world assets, and [automated market makers (AMMs)](https://chain.link/education-hub/what-is-an-automated-market-maker-amm) use price oracles to help concentrate liquidity at the current market price to improve capital efficiency.

* **Price Feeds**: Oracles provide accurate and real-time price data for cryptocurrencies, fiat currencies, commodities, and other financial assets. This data is crucial for DeFi applications like lending platforms (e.g., Aave, Compound), decentralized exchanges (e.g., Uniswap, Sushiswap), and derivatives markets (e.g., Synthetix).  
* **Lending and Borrowing**: Oracles ensure that collateral is accurately valued in real-time, enabling platforms to calculate interest rates, trigger liquidations, and manage risk.  
* **Stablecoins**: For stablecoins like DAI, oracles provide the price data necessary to maintain the peg to a fiat currency, ensuring stability.

### Gaming and NFTs

Oracles also enable non-financial use cases for smart contracts, such as dynamic NFTs that can change in appearance, value, or distribution based on external events like the time of day or the weather. 

Additionally, compute oracles can generate verifiable random numbers for projects, which can be used to assign randomized traits to NFTs or select lucky winners in high-demand NFT drops. 

Onchain gaming applications also use verifiable randomness to create more engaging and unpredictable gameplay experiences, such as the appearance of random loot boxes or randomized matchmaking during a tournament.

### Insurance

[Insurance](https://blog.chain.link/blockchain-insurance/) smart contracts use input oracles to verify the occurrence of insurable events during claims processing, opening up access to physical sensors, web APIs, satellite imagery, and legal data. Output oracles can also provide insurance smart contracts with a way to make payouts on claims using other blockchains or traditional payment networks.

* [Parametric Insurance](https://blog.chain.link/parametric-insurance-smart-contract/): Oracles can trigger automatic payouts based on predefined conditions. For example, suppose a specific weather event occurs (e.g., rainfall above a certain level, such as hurricane landfall). In that case, the oracle provides this data to the smart contract, which then automatically pays out claims without needing a traditional process.  
* [Crop Insurance](https://chain.link/techtalks/arbol-parametric-insurance): Farmers can use blockchain-based insurance where oracles provide data on weather conditions, crop yields, or other factors. If the oracle reports a drought or flood, the insurance smart contract can automatically compensate the farmer.

### Enterprise

[Cross-chain](https://chain.link/education/cross-chain) oracles offer enterprises a secure blockchain middleware that allows them to connect their backend systems to any blockchain network. In doing so, [enterprise systems](https://blog.chain.link/chainlink-enterprise-blockchain-middleware/) can read/write to any blockchain and perform complex logic on deploying assets and data across chains and with counterparties using the same oracle network. Institutions can quickly join blockchains in high demand by their counterparties and swiftly create support for smart contract services their users want without spending time and development resources integrating with each blockchain.

### Sustainability Incentivization

Hybrid smart contracts are advancing [environmental sustainability](https://chain.link/use-cases/climate-markets) by creating better incentives to partake in green practices through advanced verification techniques around the true impact of green initiatives. Oracles are a critical tool for supplying smart contracts with environmental data from sensor readings, satellite imagery, and advanced ML computation, allowing smart contracts to dispense rewards to people practicing reforestation or engaging in conscious consumption. Oracles are also supporting many new forms of carbon credits to offset the impacts of climate change.
