## Compiling and Deploying Smart Contracts Using the Remix IDE

### Deploying the Smart Contract

|||


With MetaMask connected, you can deploy your smart contract by clicking the **Deploy** button in the Deploy & Run Transactions panel.

MetaMask will prompt you to confirm the transaction.   
Review the gas fees and click "Confirm".

When a smart contract is deployed with Remix, it appears in the left panel under Deploy and Run Transactions.

Go to the bottom, and your smart contract will appear under the **Deployed Contracts** section.   
You can find the smart contract name: **Register**  
Next to the name is its address.

Each smart contract created has its unique address in the deployed network. 

Copy the smart contract address and save it.

For example, the Register address created here is   
0x590955E5c7cebC3cbc15ee9B6737953706F6601D

If you close Remix (or the lesson) and open it again, you will lose the smart contract address deployed here.
