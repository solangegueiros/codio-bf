## How Developers and Non-Developers Can Create a Basic Smart Contract

|||


You can publish a smart contract even if you are not a developer\!  
You are not creating the smart contract from zero; you will “copy and paste” the code and understand the commands and what part does. If you are not a developer, it probably will not be easy to make some changes in the smart contract, but you can do other courses later to become a smart contract developer.

When you create a smart contract, publish it, and interact with it, you understand blockchain in practice, and this will make a difference as a blockchain architect or project manager, for example.

The Remix IDE is the quickest and most efficient way to deploy a basic smart contract. It offers a clean, user-friendly interface that’s easy to configure and use.
