## Solidity Concepts: Language Version and Smart Contract Structure

Let's break down this Solidity code line by line.

// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT

// denotes a comment in Solidity.  
Having a comment in the first line informing the license type is a good practice.

This line specifies the license under which the code is distributed.   
The SPDX-License-Identifier is a standard way to declare open-source licenses in smart contracts.   
MIT refers to the MIT License, a permissive free software license.

pragma solidity 0.8.19;

The pragma directive specifies the Solidity compiler version.

contract Register {

Here is the contract declaration, including the name, called Register.   
Everything between the braces {} will be the smart contract code.  
A contract in Solidity is similar to a class in object-oriented programming; it contains functions and state variables.

string private info;

This is a declaration of a state variable named info.  
The info variable has the type string and will store some string data.  
State variables are data that will be stored on the blockchain.  
The private keyword means that this variable can only be accessed by functions within this contract. The info variable will store some string data.

function getInfo() public view returns (string memory) {

This line declares a public function named getInfo that returns a string.   
The view keyword indicates that this function will not modify the state of the contract.   
The returns (string memory) specify that the function returns a string stored in memory.  
Everything between the braces {} will be executed when the function is called.

return info;

This line returns the value stored in the info variable.   
Since info is a private variable, this function provides a way to read its value outside the contract.

function setInfo(string memory \_info) public {

This line declares a public function, setInfo, that takes a parameter \_info of type string memory.   
The memory keyword indicates that this string is a temporary value that exists only during the function's execution.   
This function will be used to set or update the info variable.  
Everything between the braces {} will be executed when the function is called.

info \= \_info;

This line assigns the value passed to the function (\_info) to the state variable info.   
It effectively updates the stored string in the contract.

### Register.sol Summary

This contract, Register, is a simple Solidity contract that allows storing and retrieving a single string.   
It has a private state variable info, a public function getInfo to read the value of info, and another public function setInfo to update the value of info.
