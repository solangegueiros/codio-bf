You can check out the smart contract on the block explorer as well.

Go to [https://sepolia.etherscan.io/](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/) 

Paste the Register address in the search field in the Sepolia Etherscan.

You can see some information related to the smart contract, like the transaction where it was created.  
[https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x590955e5c7cebc3cbc15ee9b6737953706f6601d](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x590955e5c7cebc3cbc15ee9b6737953706f6601d)

Note that when a smart contract is created, the TO field is “Contract creation” and used to be the address 0x0, because it is not interacting with another address yet.

Another option to see the transaction on the block explorer is  
Go to Metamask  
Open the last transaction: “Contract creation”.   
Click on “View on block explorer”.

This is the transaction made to create the smart contract.

In order to see the smart contract itself, click on the address in the “To” field near the “Created” word.
