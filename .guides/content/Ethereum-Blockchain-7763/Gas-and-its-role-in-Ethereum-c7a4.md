## Gas and Its Role in Ethereum

Gas is the fuel that allows transactions to be included in blocks on Blockchain, just as a car needs gasoline to run. Gas refers to the unit that measures the amount of computational effort required to execute specific operations on the Ethereum network.

Since each Ethereum transaction requires computational resources to execute, those resources must be paid for to ensure Ethereum is not vulnerable to spam and cannot get stuck in infinite computational loops. Payment for computation is made in the form of a gas fee.

The gas fee is the amount of gas required to perform an operation multiplied by the cost per unit of gas. The fee is paid regardless of whether a transaction succeeds or fails.
