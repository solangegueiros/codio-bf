## Introduction to Ethereum and Smart Contracts

|||


Imagine a digital world where contracts execute themselves, applications run without central servers, and financial transactions happen seamlessly without intermediaries. This is the vision of Ethereum, a platform that has revolutionized the blockchain space since its launch in 2015 by Vitalik Buterin and a group of co-founders. 

The Ethereum blockchain is a decentralized, open-source blockchain platform that enables developers to build and deploy smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps).

Ethereum extends the capabilities of blockchain technology beyond what was initially possible with Bitcoin, enabling programmable, self-executing contracts that automatically enforce agreements.

Ethereum has become a cornerstone of the decentralized digital landscape, enabling innovative applications and transforming industries.

From [https://ethereum.org/](https://ethereum.org/):   
Ethereum is a network of computers all over the world that follow a set of rules called the Ethereum protocol. The Ethereum network acts as the foundation for communities, applications, organizations and digital assets that anyone can build and use.  
Ethereum is the community-run technology powering the cryptocurrency ether (ETH) and thousands of decentralized applications.  
Ethereum is not controlled by any particular entity. It exists whenever there are connected computers running software following the Ethereum protocol and adding to the Ethereum blockchain. Each of these computers is known as a node. Nodes can be run by anyone.
