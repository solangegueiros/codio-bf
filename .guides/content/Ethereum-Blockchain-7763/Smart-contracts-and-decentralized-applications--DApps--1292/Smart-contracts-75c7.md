## Smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps)

### Smart contracts

Smart contracts are computer programs living on the Ethereum blockchain. They execute when triggered by a transaction from a user.   
A smart contract is a collection of code (its functions) and data (its state) that resides at a specific address on the Ethereum blockchain.

They can also be defined as self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. They automatically execute and enforce the terms when certain conditions are met.

Smart contracts are a type of Ethereum account. This means they have a balance and can be the target of transactions. However they're not controlled by a user, instead they are deployed to the network and run as programmed. User accounts can then interact with a smart contract by submitting transactions that execute a function defined on the smart contract. Smart contracts can define rules, like a regular contract, and automatically enforce them via the code. Smart contracts cannot be deleted by default, and interactions with them are irreversible.
