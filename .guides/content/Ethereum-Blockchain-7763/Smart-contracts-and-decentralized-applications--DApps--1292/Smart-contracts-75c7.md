## Smart Contracts and Decentralized Applications (dApps)

### Smart Contracts

Smart contracts are computer programs living on the Ethereum blockchain. They execute when triggered by a transaction from a user. 

A smart contract is a collection of code (its functions) and data (its state) residing at a specific address on the blockchain.

They can also be defined as self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. They automatically execute and enforce the terms when certain conditions are met.

A user does not control smart contracts, instead they are deployed to the network and run as programmed. User accounts can then interact with a smart contract by submitting transactions that execute a function defined on the smart contract. Smart contracts can define rules, like a regular contract, and automatically enforce them via the code. They cannot be deleted by default, and interactions with them are irreversible.
