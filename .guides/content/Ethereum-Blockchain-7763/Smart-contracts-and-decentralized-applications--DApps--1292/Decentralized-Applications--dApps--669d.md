### Decentralized Applications (dApps)

A Decentralized Application (dApp) is a type of software application that runs on a decentralized network, like Ethereum, rather than on a centralized server. It uses smart contracts to manage their logic and interact with the blockchain.

dApps leverage the underlying blockchain technology to ensure they are open, transparent, and resistant to censorship or control by any single entity.

A decentralized application (dApp) combines a smart contract and a frontend user interface. On Ethereum, smart contracts are accessible and transparent—like open APIs—so your dApp can even include a smart contract that someone else has written.

A dApp has its backend code running on a decentralized peer-to-peer network. Contrast this with an app where the backend code is running on centralized servers.

A dApp can have frontend code and user interfaces written in any language (just like an app) to make calls to its backend. Furthermore, its front end can be hosted on decentralized storage.

### Key Characteristics of dApps

Decentralized—dApps operate on Ethereum, an open public decentralized platform where no one person or group has control.

Deterministic—dApps perform the same function irrespective of the environment in which they get executed.

Turing complete—dApps can perform any action given the required resources.

Isolated—dApps are executed in a virtual environment known as the Ethereum Virtual Machine so that if the smart contract has a bug, it won’t hamper the normal functioning of the blockchain network.
