## State Machines and Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)

### State Machines

The finite-state machine (FSM) can change from one state to another in response to some inputs; the change from one state to another is called a transition.  
A state machine is a behavior model. It consists of a finite number of states and is therefore also called FSM. Based on the current state and a given input the machine performs state transitions and produces outputs.
