## What you can do using a block explorer

|||


### Transaction Tracking

Block explorers allow users to search for specific transactions by entering a transaction ID (TXID) or hash. This feature provides details such as the transaction status (confirmed or pending), the amount of cryptocurrency or token sent, the addresses involved, and when the transaction was processed.

### Block Details

Users can view information about individual blocks, such as the block number, timestamp, size, and the number of transactions it contains. 

Block explorers also show the validator who added the block to the blockchain and the associated block reward.

### Address Lookup

Block explorers enable users to search for blockchain addresses to see their balance and transaction history, including incoming and outgoing transactions, the total amount of cryptocurrency or tokens sent and received, and the current balance.

### Blockchain Analytics

Some block explorers provide additional analytics and insights, such as the overall network hash rate, transaction fees, and historical data trends. These features can be helpful for developers, researchers, and traders who need to analyze blockchain performance.

### Smart Contract Interaction

Block explorers, like Ethereum and other EVM compatibles, often provide tools to interact with and monitor smart contracts on blockchains that support them. 

You can publish the smart contractâ€™s source code to verify your smart contract. After that, users can view it, check the contract balance, and analyze contract events. 

Even if the source code is not published, the block explorer can find similar bytecodes in already published smart contracts and reveal them. 

Some block explorers allow you to connect your wallet and send transactions by calling functions in smart contracts.
