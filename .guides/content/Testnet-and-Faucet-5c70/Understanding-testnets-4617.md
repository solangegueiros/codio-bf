## Understanding testnets

In [blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain) technology, a testnet is an instance of a blockchain that’s powered by the same or a newer version of the underlying software. It is used for testing and experimentation without risk to real funds or the main chain. Testnet [coins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency) are separate and distinct from the official (mainnet) coins. They don't have value and can be obtained freely from faucets.

A testnet is a blockchain to play around. There’s no real money involved.

Each blockchain has its testnets. Some of them have more than one. Ethereum already has some testnets that are deprecated. At present (2024), Ethereum has two active testnets: Sepolia and Holesky.

Both testnets have differences. Sepolia is primarily utilized for decentralized application (DApp) stress tests, smart contract experiments, and other Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) functions. Holesky is specifically designed for more technical purposes, which include experimenting with staking designs, testing general infrastructure, and developing protocol-level concepts.

### Enabling testnets on Metamask

The blockchain default setup on Metamask is the Ethereum mainnet.

You can switch which blockchain (defaulting to mainnet Ethereum) you are on, including using testnets.

1. Open your MetaMask Wallet by going to the Extensions tab on Chrome.

2. Click on the top left button and then click on the toggle button for **Show test networks**

Since you are going to be interacting with smart contracts, you are going to use **Sepolia**.

### Sepolia Testnet

Sepolia is the recommended default testnet by Ethereum core developers for smart contract application development.
