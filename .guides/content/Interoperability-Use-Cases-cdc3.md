## Interoperability Use Cases

|||



[Interoperability](https://chain.link/education-hub/blockchain-interoperability) between multiple blockchains helps assets to flow between networks.    
For example, token swaps involve submitting a token on a source chain and receiving a different token on a destination chain. Cross-chain token swaps are generally made possible by atomic swap protocols and/or cross-chain automated market makers (AMMs), which maintain separate liquidity pools on each blockchain to facilitate the swap. 

Some of the notable use cases of blockchain interoperability are: 

### Cross-Chain Asset Transfers

Users can transfer assets (e.g., tokens, cryptocurrencies) from one blockchain to another without requiring a centralized exchange. For example, Bitcoin (BTC) could be moved to Ethereum as a wrapped token (WBTC) for use in Ethereum-based decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.

### Token Swaps

Interoperability allows users to exchange tokens across different blockchains. For example, a user might swap Ethereum (ETH) for Binance Coin (BNB) using a cross-chain automated market maker (AMM) that maintains liquidity on both Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain, facilitating smooth and secure token exchanges.

### [Cross-Chain NFTs](https://chain.link/education-hub/cross-chain-nft)

Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) can be moved or used across different blockchain networks, enabling broader markets, greater liquidity, and more extensive use cases for digital assets.

### Cross-Chain Governance

DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations) can implement governance across multiple blockchains. For instance, a vote passed on a DAO in the Ethereum network could automatically initiate changes in a connected protocol on another blockchain, ensuring coordinated governance actions across platforms.

### Programmable Token Bridges

[Programmable token bridges](https://blog.chain.link/ccip-programmable-token-transfers/) combine token bridging with arbitrary messaging. As soon as the tokens are delivered to the destination chain from the source chain, a contract call can be executed. This happens in a single transaction, enabling richer cross-chain functionality, such as staking, swapping, or depositing tokens into a smart contract on the destination chain as part of completing the bridge function.

### Enterprise Blockchain Integration

Enterprises that use different private or permissioned blockchains can interact with public or other enterprise blockchains, enabling broader integration and data sharing across various platforms.
