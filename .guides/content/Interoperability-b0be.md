## Understanding the Concept of Interoperability Within the Blockchain Space

Blockchain interoperability standards are essential for the Web3 ecosystem and traditional systems that need to interact with different blockchains. These standards are the foundation for building blockchain abstraction layers, allowing traditional backends and dApps to interact with any blockchain network through a single middleware solution. Without blockchain interoperability standards, Web2 systems and dApps would need to build separate in-house implementations for each cross-chain interaction that they want to use, which is a time-consuming, resource-intensive, and complex process.
