## What is Blockchain

A [blockchain](https://chain.link/education-hub/blockchain) is a distributed ledger that maintains a continuously growing list of ordered records called "blocks." The blocks are linked together and secured using cryptography.

### Blockchain

A blockchain is a distributed ledger with growing lists of records (blocks) securely linked together via cryptographic hashes. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data (generally represented as a Merkle tree, where data nodes are represented by leaves). Since each block contains information about the previous block, they effectively form a chain, with each additional block linking to the ones before. Consequently, blockchain transactions are irreversible in that, once they are recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without altering all subsequent blocks.
