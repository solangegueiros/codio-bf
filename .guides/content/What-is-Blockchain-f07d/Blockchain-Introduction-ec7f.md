## What is Blockchain

A blockchain is a distributed ledger that maintains a continuously growing list of ordered records, called "blocks", that are linked together and secured using cryptography.

### Blockchain

A blockchain is a [distributed ledger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed\_ledger) with growing lists of [records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record\_(computer\_science)) (blocks) that are securely linked together via [cryptographic hashes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic\_hash\_function). Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a [timestamp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted\_timestamping), and transaction data (generally represented as a [Merkle tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle\_tree), where [data nodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node\_(computer\_science)) are represented by leaves). Since each block contains information about the previous block, they effectively form a chain (compare [linked list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked\_list) data structure), with each additional block linking to the ones before it. Consequently, blockchain transactions are irreversible in that, once they are recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without altering all subsequent blocks.
