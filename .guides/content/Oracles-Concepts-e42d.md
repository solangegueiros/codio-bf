# Oracle Concepts and Its Importance in Connecting Blockchains With Each Other and the World

[Oracles](https://chain.link/education/blockchain-oracles) are services that provide external data to blockchain-based smart contracts, enabling them to interact with information outside the blockchain.

Oracles solve this issue as middleware, facilitating secure and reliable communication between onchain and offchain environments.
