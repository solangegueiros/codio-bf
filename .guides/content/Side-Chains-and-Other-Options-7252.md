### Side Chains

Side chains are blockchains that run parallel to Ethereum. They have their own consensus mechanisms and security models and are connected to Ethereum via bridges.

Side chains examples: [Gnosis](https://www.gnosis.io/), [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/)

### Other Options

Plasma chains are smaller blockchains that run alongside the Ethereum mainnet. They allow for offchain transactions and periodic summary submission to the mainnet. 

Validium is similar to [ZK-Rollups](https://chain.link/education-hub/zero-knowledge-rollup), using zero-knowledge proofs for transaction validation. However, it stores the data offchain, which can lead to greater scalability at the cost of decentralization.
