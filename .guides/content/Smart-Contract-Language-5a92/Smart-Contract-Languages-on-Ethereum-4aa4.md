## Smart Contract Languages on Ethereum

|||


Ethereum, the pioneering blockchain platform for decentralized applications, supports various smart contract languages designed to create, deploy, and interact with smart contracts. These languages enable developers to write the code that runs on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), the decentralized computation engine that processes smart contracts.

Solidity, Vyper, and Yul/Yul+ are the primary languages used for Ethereum smart contract development. This course will focus on Solidity.
