# Smart Contract Languages

[Smart contracts](https://chain.link/education/smart-contracts) are computer programs deployed and executed on a [blockchain](https://chain.link/education-hub/blockchain), operating autonomously once triggered. Once deployed, these contracts are immutable, meaning their code cannot be altered. They function without intermediaries, automatically executing predefined actions when called, making them highly reliable for decentralized applications (dApps).


## Programming Language Concepts

Programming languages allow developers to instruct computers to perform specific tasks. These languages have certain fundamental concepts that are shared across most programming environments.

Programming languages used to be human-readable code, which will be converted to machine-readable code, called bytecode.
