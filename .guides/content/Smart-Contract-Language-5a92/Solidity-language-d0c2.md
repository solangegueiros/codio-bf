## Solidity Language

|||

[Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/) is a high-level programming language designed specifically for writing smart contracts on blockchain platforms, most notably on Ethereum, although it is widely used across a range of EVM-compatible blockchains.

Key features of Solidity:

* Object-oriented language influenced by C++, Python, and JavaScript.  
* [Curly-bracket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_programming\_languages\_by\_type\#Curly-bracket\_languages) language, where the characters { and } define statement blocks.  
* Solidity is statically typed, meaning that types (such as uint, string, etc.) are determined at compile time, which helps catch errors early in the development process.  
* Supports inheritance, libraries, and complex user-defined types, among other features.

Solidity is better for new smart contract developers because it comes with built-in protective measuresâ€”which can prevent costly mistakes. As the most widely used language in [Web3](https://chain.link/education/web3), Solidity developers have access to more libraries and tooling, better documentation, and increased developer support in forums.
